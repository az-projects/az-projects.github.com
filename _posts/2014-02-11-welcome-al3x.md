Our mission at DOBT is to help government agencies create delightful experiences for their users, and we do this by supplying them with beautiful, modern software and technology talent. Convincing skilled engineers to work in an industry that is known for its beauracracy and sluggishness isn't easy, but we work hard to create a pipeline where top tier technical talent can work on stuff that matters.

And our efforts are starting to pay off: today, we’re thrilled to announce that [Alex Payne](http://al3x.net) has joined our team. Alex is an engineer behind some of the most amazing technology companies on the web today — he was one of the first engineering hires over at Twitter as well as a co-founder of Simple, a new kind of banking experience for consumers. We’re excited for him to bring his skills to our clients and products.

I’ve wanted to work with Alex for a long time, and it’s great to finally get the opportunity not only to do that, but to provide him with a platform to work in a space that can benefit so much from his talents. You can read more about why he decided to come work at DOBT over on [his blog](http://al3x.net/2014/02/11/back-to-my-roots.html), too.

And if you’re a government (or affiliated) entity and interested in having us a take a shot at fixing some of your particularly nasty technical issues, now is a great time to [get in touch](http://dobt.co/#contact).

#### Welcome, Alex!
