<p>It was a full year ago that Adam, Jed, and I started as Presidential Innovation Fellows to make <a href="http://rfpez.sba.gov">RFP-EZ:</a> The software that ended up <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/15/rfp-ez-delivers-savings-taxpayers-new-opportunities-small-business">saving the government 30%</a> on IT purchases. It was a remarkable journey that not only ended up in a successful shipment of software, but also a lot of lessons learned.</p>

<p>We took some time to reflect on that effort earlier this year. Now we&rsquo;re happy to release an edited, lessons-learned document that we&rsquo;ve turned into an e-book called <a href="http://www.dobt.co/fixing-procurement-ebook/">&ldquo;7 Simple Ways to Modernize Enterprise Procurement.&rdquo;</a> It&rsquo;s a white paper on what we learned during RFP-EZ, where I think we succeeded, and where I think we ought to go.</p>
<p>Procurement is complicated. If you&rsquo;re thinking about modernizing procurement in your area, these are some very pragmatic ideas about where improvement can begin. We hope it helps.</p>
