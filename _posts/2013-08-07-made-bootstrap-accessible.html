<p>One thing that&rsquo;s been frustrating about developing apps for the government web is that some of the great front-end frameworks we use don&rsquo;t take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973">accessibility</a> into account. A week ago I announced our plan to <a href="http://www.dobt.co/making-bootstrap-accessible/">add some modest accessibility improvements</a> to Bootstrap, and asked some friends from Code for America and the White House&rsquo;s Presidential Innovation Fellows program to help contribute.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to announce that as of today, our changes have been <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9137">merged into the main Bootstrap repo</a>. Our work isn&rsquo;t completely done, (in round 2, we&rsquo;ll start testing Bootstrap with an actual screen reader,) but we&rsquo;ve already achieved significant progress in making Bootstrap more friendly to users of assistive technology.</p>
<p>Major credit is due to the folks that showed up to hack, both in-person and virtually: <a href="http://www.github.com/criscristina">@criscristina</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/dannychapman">@dannychapman</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/louh">@louh</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/bensheldon">@bensheldon</a>, and <a href="http://www.github.com/jasonlally">@jasonlally</a>. Thanks everybody for helping out!</p>
