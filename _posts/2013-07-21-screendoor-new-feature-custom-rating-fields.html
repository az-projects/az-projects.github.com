<p>Today we&rsquo;re launching a new feature in <a href="https://www.screendoor.io">Screendoor</a>: <strong>custom review fields</strong>. We&rsquo;ve had this one on our minds for a while, and we think that it will make Screendoor an even more effective tool for reviewing large numbers of applicants.</p>
<p>With all of our features we want to make sure that we keep Screendoor as simple as possible, so when adding customization to the application, we <em>never want to create more work for you, our user.</em> Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>
<p>When you create a project in screendoor, we create an overall rating field for you:</p>
<p><img alt="default rating fields" src="http://cl.ly/image/032N2S2D1O1M/Screen%20Shot%202013-07-21%20at%208.19.58%20PM.png" /></p>
<p>This should be enough for most use cases, but if you want to rank your responses on say, a combination of &ldquo;skill&rdquo;, &ldquo;experience&rdquo;, and &ldquo;creativity&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s as easy as creating those three fields here:</p>
<p><img alt="custom rating fields page" src="http://cl.ly/image/2H3b3J113A2f/Screen%20Shot%202013-07-21%20at%208.19.43%20PM.png" /></p>
<p>This will let your reviews rank each response multiple times, and the system will <strong>automatically calculate the average rating across all fields</strong> and display it to you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just one way to rank responses. You also have the option of reviewing by response field &ndash; so you can ask your reviewers to rate a specific section of a response, like so:</p>
<p><img alt="response field rating fields" src="http://cl.ly/image/163x060C2G1A/Screen%20Shot%202013-07-21%20at%208.09.30%20PM.png" /></p>
<p>Right now, you have the option between Stars, Red/Yellow/Green, a Number Range, and Free Response. Here&rsquo;s what they look like, all in a row:</p>

<p>This should be a ton of help for anyone who is managing a ton of reviewers, or integrating Screendoor with an already-established review process. And it opens up all kinds of possiblities for new features &ndash; weighted review fields? Bid discounts for registered vendors? As always, drop us a note to let us know what you think!</p>
