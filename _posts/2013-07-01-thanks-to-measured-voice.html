<p>One big problem we have in getting government to use new technology is the <a href="http://www.dobt.co/Fixing-Procurement-7-Standard-Terms-Of-Service/">Terms of Service</a> problem. See, unlike you and me, government employees can&rsquo;t just &ldquo;click through&rdquo; a legally binding contract without reading it. Instead, if you want to buy something, you&rsquo;ve got to have your counsel read through the Terms, and often, negotiate with the service providing the terms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why for a lot of small businesses, it&rsquo;s good to have some kind of standardized terms. Eventually, we want to get to the point where Counsel says &ldquo;oh, I&rsquo;ve seen these terms before. It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We love <a href="http://measuredvoice.com">MeasuredVoice</a> &ndash; they&rsquo;re out there selling, working on solving a hard problem (helping government listen better) and, like us, working on stuff that matters. So when we noticed that they had <a href="http://measuredvoice.com/terms/">developed their own Terms</a> with GSA, we asked if we could steal them. <a href="http://blog.measuredvoice.com/post/54034472250/serving-the-servants">And they oblidged</a>. They even <a href="https://gist.github.com/jedsundwall/5825709">put it up on github</a>.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve got something we can work with &ndash; a template, a place to start. Let&rsquo;s work together to craft a terms document that works for everybody, so we can focus on what we do best &ndash; making great software.</p>
