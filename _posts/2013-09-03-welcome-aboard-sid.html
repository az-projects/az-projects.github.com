<p>I'm so happy we managed to talk Sid Burgess into joining our team here at the Department. Sid is now the guy that links our great technology to the people who need it.</p>
<p>Sid's been around the space for quite some time (12 years!), and I admire his passion for using the web to improve the lives of everyday people. He's a fire fighter, a former city councilman, a combat medic and the president of a community non-profit. And now he's our new government liaison. I couldn't be more thrilled.</p>
<p>The notion that we can improve government by going upstream and giving people on the inside tools they love, and tools that help make great decisions just got a little more realistic. Welcome aboard, Sid!</p>
