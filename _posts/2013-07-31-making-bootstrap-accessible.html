title: Making Bootstrap accessible

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been working on making Screendoor &ldquo;508 compliant&rdquo;. <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a> is a federal law stating that all IT systems must be accessible to users with disabilities &ndash; kind of like <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">WCAG</a>, except mandated by the federal government. In it&rsquo;s most simplified form, it&rsquo;s basically a checklist of accessibility best-practices that all federal websites need to follow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, everyone&rsquo;s favorite <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a> is rife with accessibility issues. Things like using the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag for icon classes, using anchor tags to toggle menus&hellip; and some trickier ones, like encouraging users to use non-semantic header nesting. (Is the biggest header on your site an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>? no? <em>bzzzzzzz</em>)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why this weekend we&rsquo;re hosting an informal gathering in Oakland (and virtually) to work on making Bootstrap follow accessibility best-practices. Where we need your help is filing issues &ndash; before Sunday, we would love to have a fairly comprehensive list of where Bootstrap fails 508 and WCAG guidelines. I&rsquo;ve started building the list, and would love any and all help filling it out:</p>

<p>Bootstrap is already a great foundation for any web project. We hope that after some concerted efforts this weekend, that foundation will be accessible, too.</p>
