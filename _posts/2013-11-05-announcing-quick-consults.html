<p>Today we're launching&nbsp;<a href="http://consults.dobt.co/">Quick Consults</a>&nbsp;Whether you need to bring someone in to take a look at an RFP, figure out what's going on with some Ruby code, or work on that strategic plan, we're here to help. And fast.</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>There's flat rate pricing. Most projects will start at and be limited to $150.</li>
<li>You fill out a form, we get back to you, quickly, with an invoice and some suggested times.</li>
<li>We get together via phone, Skype, Google Hangout, or in person and work on your request.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm excited about DOBT Consults because a few hundred dollars spent early-on could save the government millions down the road.</p>
