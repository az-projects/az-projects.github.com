We just shipped two new features in Screendoor, and we think they're so awesome that we couldn't wait to tell you about them.

<!-- more -->

### 1) Table Inputs

We've added the Table to the list of input types in Screendoor's form builder. You can define your columns, optionally set a minimum and maximum number of rows, and choose whether or not to calculate column totals. Take a look:

<div class='media_wrapper'>
  <img src='/images/screendoor-tables.gif' />
</div>

### 2) Multi-page forms

Nothing hurts your conversions worse than a page with too many form fields, so we added the ability to insert page breaks in your long forms:

<div class='media_wrapper'>
  <img src='/images/screendoor-multi-page-forms.gif' />
</div>

--------

If you're already using Screendoor, these features are live and ready-to-use today. If you're not, just [contact us](http://www.dobt.co/#contact) for a demo or to get setup with an account. We look forward to making your "Screening" more collaborative and efficient!
